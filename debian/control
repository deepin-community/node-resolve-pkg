Description: Resolve the path of a package regardless of it having an entry point
 Some packages like CLI tools and grunt tasks don't have a entry point, like
 `"main": "foo.js"` in package.json, resulting in them not being resolvable by
 `require.resolve()`. Unlike `require.resolve()`, this module also resolves
 packages without an entry point, returns `null` instead of throwing when the
 module can't be found, and resolves from `process.cwd()` instead `__dirname`
 by default.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
